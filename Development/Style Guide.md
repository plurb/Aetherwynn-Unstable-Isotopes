# Aetherwynn Style Guide

<!--

## General

References to ability scores looks like:

```md
... Constitution Saving Throw ...
```

```md
... Strength ...
```

Since the ability score used by a skill check can change, the check to be made is listed first, and the ability score to be used is put in brackets.

```md
... Athletics (Strength) ...
```

Flavor text looks like:

```md
> *This is flavor text.*
```

Formulas are in inline code:

```md
... `2d8 + 2` ...
```

'X' formatting is used wherever a number scales using an external variable.

```md
`Xd8 + 2`, where `X = `...
```

Keywords can be links to the appropriate keyword's description:

```md
[keyword](https://www.example.com)
```

They can also be capitalised.

```md
... Keyword ...
```

Saving throws are styled as:

```md
[Affected creatures] make a(n) [Ability] Saving Throw.

**Failure:** Effects on a failure.
**Success:** Effects on a success.
```

If nothing occurs on a success or on a failure, then that section may be omitted for brevity.

In-line Saving throws (like on monster statblocks) are styled as:

```md
[Affected creatures] make a(n) [Ability] Saving Throw. **Failure:** Effects on a failure. **Success:** Effects on a success.
```

## Classes and Class Abilities

Class name goes in `# Heading 1`.

Class abilities go in `## Heading 2`.

## References to Abilities and Tags

References to specific abilities or tags go in qoutes, "like this".

Examples:

```md
"Attack" Action
```

```md
"Cunning Action"
```

```md
"Fireball"
```
