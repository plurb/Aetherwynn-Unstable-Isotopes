## Evasion
*7th-level Ability (Barbarian, Monk, Rogue)*

> *You are able to avoid attacks that are otherwise unavoidable.*

♾️ — Whenever a creature makes an *Attack* vs *Reflex* against you, or the ability has the "Blast" tag, you take no Damage if the *Attack* misses, and only half as much Damage if it hits.
