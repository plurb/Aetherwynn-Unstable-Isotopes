## Exploits
*1st-level Ability ({class}, Exploits)*

> *Flavour text.*

You gain the following attributes and abilities.

### Stamina Points
*Attribute ({class}, Exploits, Stamina Points)*  

> *Flavour text.*

You have a number of "Stamina Points" calculated as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your {class} level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0)`

You regain all expended "Stamina Points" when you finish a *Short Rest*.

### Exploits Known
*Attribute ({class}, Exploits)*  

You know `X` Exploits from the *[{class} Exploit List]*, where `X = the number shown in the "Exploits Known" column of the {class} table`. To learn an Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level (as shown in the "Exploit Level" column of the {class} table), as well as meet any other pre-requisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in tags of the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a {class} level, you can replace one Exploit you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the *[{class} Exploit List]*.

To perform an Exploit, you expend a number of "Stamina Points" equal to the Exploit's level. For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, or *Ability Check*: you can only use one Exploit per *Attack*, or *Ability Check*.

### Exploit Ability
*Attribute ({class}, Exploits)*  

If one of your Exploits requires you to make an *Exploit Attack*, or a creature to make a *Check*, your "Exploit Attack Modifier", and "Exploit DC" are calculated as follows:

**Exploit Attack Modifier** = `+ your Proficiency Bonus + your {ability score} modifier`
**Exploit DC** = `10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your {ability score} modifier`
