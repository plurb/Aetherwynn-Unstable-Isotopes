A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw and takes `Xd6 + 40` force damage, where `X = 4 + this spell's level`. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

**Failure:** The creature takes full damage.  
**Success:** The creature takes half damage.
