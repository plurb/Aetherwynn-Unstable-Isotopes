### Alien Tentacles
*4th-level conjuration*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

> *Squirming, ebony tentacles erupt from the ground, grasping whatever they feel.*

Target a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. Until this spell ends, this area is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature makes a Dexterity Saving Throw.

**Failure:** The creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is *restrained* until the spell ends. 

A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by this spell takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

**Classes:** Warlock, Wizard, Sorcerer
