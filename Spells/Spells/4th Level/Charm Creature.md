### Charm Creature
*4th-level Enchantment*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You attempt to charm a creature you can see within range. 

Up to `X` target creatures you can see in range make a Wisdom saving throw (they do so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting them), where `X = this spell's level - 3`.

**Failure:** The creatures are charmed by you until this spell ends or until you or your companions deal damage to it, or it sees you or your companions deal damage to one of their companions. The charmed creatures are friendly to you.

When the spell ends, the creatures know they were charmed by you.
