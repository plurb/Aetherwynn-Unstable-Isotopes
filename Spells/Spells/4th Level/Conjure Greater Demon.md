> *Summoning demons is a risky gambit. If you don't send them back to the abyss yourself, you may find yourself in the abyss, inside their stomach.*

You [summon](https://github.com/plurb/Aetherwynn-Unstable-Isotopes/blob/main/Rules/Spellcasting/Summoned%20Creatures.md) a Demon of level `X` or lower, where `X = this spell's level + 1`. It appears in an unoccupied space where it can fit that you can see within range at the beginning of the next round.

At the beginning of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw.

**Failure:** The demon continues to obey you.  
**Success:** This spell ends.  

If this spell ends before it completes its full duration, you lose control of the demon, and **doesn't disappear** for `2d6` rounds if it still has hit points. The demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest Humanoid creature.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
