# Exploits


# What is an Exploit?
[insert explanation]

## Exploit Level
Every Exploit has a level from 0 to 5. An Exploit's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with 1st level being the weakest and 5th level being the strongest. The higher an Exploit's level, the higher level a martial must be to use that spell.

Exploit level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 5th level, to perform a 5th level Exploit.

## Known Exploits
Before a martial can perform an Exploit, they must have the Exploit firmly fixed in mind. Members of a few classes have a limited list of Exploits they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many martial monsters.

The number of Exploits a martial can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level.

## Stamina
Regardless of how many Exploits a martial knows, they can only perform a limited number of spells before resting. Moving at superhuman speeds and performing feats of legendary strength is tiring, especially for higher level Exploits. That is why each class capable of performing Exploits tells you how many Stamina Points they have.

A martial typically has a number of stamina points equal to their Constitution modifier + their Martial Level.

See *Multiclassing* for a guide on calculating a character's Martial Level.

# Performing an Exploit
When a character performs any exploit, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the Exploit's effects.

Each Exploit description begins with a block of information, including the Exploit's Name, Level, Tempo, Range, Materials, and Duration. The rest of a Exploit entry describes the Exploit's effect.

## Tempo
Exploits may require an Attack, a Reaction, a Bonus Action, an entire Action, or even longer to perform.

### Attack
Exploits requiring an attack enhance or modify the way you attack. An Exploit requiring a single attack typically states at which point of the attack they occur.

Certain Exploits may require more than one attack. These exploits modify the number of attacks specified, at the point in time specified.

If an Exploit with a Tempo of *1 Attack* deals damage, the damage is always the same type as the weapon used to perform the attack. If the weapon deals multiple damage types, then the damage type is one of the player's choice from among the types that the weapon deals.

### Bonus Actions
An Exploit with a Tempo of a Bonus Action require a single Bonus Action to perform, provided you are able to take a Bonus Action and haven't taken a Bonus Action on your turn.

### Reactions
Some exploits can be performed as a reaction. These Exploits take a fraction of a second to bring about and are performed in response to some event. If an Exploit can be performed as a reaction, the Exploit's description tells you exactly when you can do so.

## Range
The target of an Exploit must be within the Exploit's range. Exploits can target creatures or points within their range. Whether an Exploit targets a creature or a point is specified in the Exploit's description.

An Exploit that has a range of "Self" either modifies an attack you perform, or creates an Area of Effect that originates from you like a Cone or Line.

Once an Exploit is performed, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the Exploit's description says otherwise.

## Materials
Some Exploits require specific items to perform them (such as ammunition, a specific type of weapon, or a shield). You must be holding the materials required for an Exploit to perform it.

If an Exploit states that it consumes its materials, then those materials are used up and cannot be re-used, unless the Exploit says otherwise.

If you are not holding an Exploit's Materials, you must have a free hand to access them.

## Duration
An Exploit's duration is the length of time the Exploit persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some Exploits specify that their effects last until the spells are undone or their results destroyed/repaired.

### Instantaneous
Many Exploits are instantaneous. The Exploit  harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be interupted, because itis performed in an instant.

### Concentration
Some Exploits require you to concentrate to maintain their effects. You are [concentrating](https://github.com/plurb/Pluto-s-Generic-Fantasy-RPG-Unstable-Isotopes/blob/main/Rules/Conditions/Concentrating.md) as long as the effects of the Exploit persist.

## Targets
A typical Exploit requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the Exploit. An Exploit's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

## Saving Throws
Many Exploits specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your Exploits equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.
