## Initiative

### Step 1: Starting An Encounter

When the GM calls, each Player, and each creature participating in combat rolls an Initiative (Dexterity) Check. These rolls are then compiled and ordered from greatest to lowest (keep track of who rolled what!). The number rolled is the creature's "Initiative Count".

Combat starts with the creature with the highest Initiative Count.

### Step 2: Playing a Round

A round starts with the creature with the highest Initiative Count. Once that creature has finished taking its turn, then the creature with the next highest Initiative Count takes its turn. The round ends when all creatures have finished their turns. When this happens, then a new round starts.

(initiative is *not* re-rolled at the start of a round.)

### Step 3: End The Encounter

When all hostile creatures are defeated, some sort of truce is reached, or some other event or circumstance ends the combat, the encounter is over. At this point, initiative order is no longer followed (initiative "ends").
