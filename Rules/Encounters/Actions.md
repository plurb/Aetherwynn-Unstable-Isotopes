## Actions

### Types of Actions

There are various types of actions you can take. Notably, Major Actions, Minor Actions, Reaction, and Free Actions.

#### Major Action (🔷)

You can only take one Major Action per turn. You can only take Major Actions during your own turn. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters](#actions-during-encounters) that use '🔷'. Many abilities also use your Major Action.

#### Minor Action (🔵)

You can only take one Minor Action per turn. You can only take Minor Actions during your own turn. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters](#actions-during-encounters) that use '🔵'. Many abilities also use your Minor Action.

#### Free Action (◻️)

#### Reaction (⚡)

#### Passive Effect (♾️)

#### Attack (🔺)

An *Attack* is a single *Attack* made when you take the *Attack Action*, or make an *Attack of Opportunity*. An ability that takes '🔺' replaces one of the *Attacks* you make through the *Attack Action*. You cannot replaces *Attacks* made using abilities other than the *Attack Action*.

#### Move Action (➡️)

You can only take one Move Action per turn. You can only take Move Actions during your own turn. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters](#actions-during-encounters) that use '➡️'. The most common usage of a Move Action are the *Dash* Action and the *Step* Action. Some Move Actions don't use your entire Move Action that turn, instead they only take a part (for example: Taking Cover).
