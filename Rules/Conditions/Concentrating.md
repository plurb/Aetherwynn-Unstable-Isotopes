## Concentrating

Some abilities require you to maintain Concentration in order to keep their effects active. If you lose Concentration, such an ability ends.

If an ability must be maintained with Concentration, that fact appears in its Requirements (or Components) entry, and the ability's Duration specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end Concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with Concentration. The following factors can break Concentration:

* **Using another ability that requires Concentration** — You lose Concentration on an ability if you cast another ability that requires Concentration. Generally, you cannot concentrate on two abilities at once.

* **Taking damage** — Whenever you take damage while you are Concentrating on an ability, make a Constitution Saving Throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. **Failure:** you lose Concentration. If you take multiple instances of damage, you make a separate saving throw for each instance of damage.

* **Being incapacitated or killed** — You lose Concentration on an ability if you are Incapacitated or Die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you are on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration on an ability.
