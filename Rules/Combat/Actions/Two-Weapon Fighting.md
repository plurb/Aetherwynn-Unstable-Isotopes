### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the *Attack Action* and make a *Melee Weapon Attack* using a *Weapon* with the *Light* property that you're holding in one hand, you can use a *Bonus Action* to make a *Melee Weapon Attack* using a different *Melee Weapon* with the *Light* property that you're wielding in another hand.

If either *Weapon* is a *Thrown Weapon*, you can make a *Throw Weapon Attack* using the weapon, instead of making a *Melee Weapon Attack* with it.
