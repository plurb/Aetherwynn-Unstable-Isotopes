### Disintegrate  
*6th-level Transmutation*  
**Casting Time:** ðŸ”·  
**Range:** 60 ft.  
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

>*You fire a green desintagrating ray from your finger tips.*

Make a *Ranged Spell Attack* vs. *Reflex* against target creature, non-"Magical" object, or object created by a "Magical" ability in range. This *Attack* automatically hits objects.

**Success:** It takes `Xd6 + 40 [force]` *Damage*, where `X = 4 + this spell's level`. Then, if the target was a creature and has `0` HP remaining, it [becomes dust][BD]. If the target was an object and is Large or smaller, it [becomes dust][BD]. If it was an object that is Huge or larger, a 10 ft.<sup>3</sup> portion of it [becomes dust][BD].  
**Failure:** It takes half as much *Damage*.

**Classes.** Artificer, Psion, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
