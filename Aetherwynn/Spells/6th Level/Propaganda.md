> *You plant thoughts into the minds of people who hear your voice, causing them to unwittingly obey your will.*

Make a *Ranged Spell Attack* vs. *Will* against any number of Humanoid creatures who understand a language and can hear you. Creatures affected by this "Spell" are unaware of this *Attack*. You have *Advantage* on this *Attack* if the creature can also see you.

**Success:** It is *[Charmed]* by you until this "Spell" ends.  
**Failure:** The creature becomes aware you tried to *[Charm]* it.  

Creatures *[Charmed]* this way refuse to believe they were *[Charmed]* by you until this "Spell" ends, or they are no longer *[Charmed]*.

Creatures immune to the *[Charmed]* condition are not immune to "Propaganda".
