### Banishment
*4th-level Abjuration*  
**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** C, V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)  
**Duration:** Up to 1 minute  

> *You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence.*

Up to `X` target creature(s) you can see in range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished, where `X = this spell's level - 3`.

**Failure:** If the target is native to the plane of existence it is currently on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

**Success:** If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one it is on, it is sent to its home plane. If the spell ends before the full duration of this spell has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.

**Classes:** Cleric, Magus, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
