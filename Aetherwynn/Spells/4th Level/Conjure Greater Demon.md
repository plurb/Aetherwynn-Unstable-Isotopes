> *Summoning demons is a risky gambit. If you don't send them back to the abyss yourself, you may find yourself in the abyss, inside their stomach.*

You *[Summon]* a Demon of level `X` or lower, where `X = this spell's level + 1` from the list below. It appears in an unoccupied space where it can fit that you can see within range at the beginning of the next round.

At the beginning of each of the demon's turns, make a *DC* `The demon's Will` Spellcasting Check. *(You make a Spellcasting Check by rolling `1d20 + your Spellcasting modifier + your Proficiency Bonus` vs the specified DC.)*

**Failure:** This Spell ends.  

If this Spell ends before it completes its full duration, you lose control of the demon, and it **does not disappear** for `2d6` rounds if it still has *HP*. The demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest Humanoid creature.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
