### Half-Swording
*Fighting Style (Fighter, Ranger, Rogue)*  

♾️ — Wielding a "Longsword" using two hands does not cause you to stop *Grappling* a creature that you are *Grappling*.

◻️ **(requires: you are wielding a "Longsword" or "Greatsword" using two hands)** — Until this ability ends, you can treat a "Sword" you are wielding as if it were one size smaller. You may use a ◻️ to end this ability at any time.
