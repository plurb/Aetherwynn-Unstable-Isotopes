### Shield Master
*Feat (Martial)*  
**Pre-requisite:** At least 4th level, the "Shield Adept" Feat  

Increase your *Strength* or *Constitution* by `1`, to a maximum of `20`.

⚡ **(requires: you are using a "Shield")** — If a creature or object makes an *Attack* vs. *Reflex* against you, you may halve the Damage you take from that *Attack*. If you do, you take no Damage if the *Attack* misses.
