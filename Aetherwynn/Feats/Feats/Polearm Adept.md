### Polearm Adept
*Feat (Martial)*  
**Pre-requisites:** Proficiency with Polearms  

◻️ — If you "Attack" using only a "Polearm", make a *Melee Weapon Attack* vs. *AC*: `your modifier` to hit, the same properties as the requisite weapon. **Success:** `1d4 + your *Damage* bonus [bludgeoning]` *Damage*.

⚡ — If a creature enters your reach, you may make an "Attack of Opportunity", regardless of other effects.
