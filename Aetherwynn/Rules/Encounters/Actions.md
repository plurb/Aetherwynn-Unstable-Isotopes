## Actions

### Types of Actions

There are various types of *Actions* you can take. Notably, *Major Actions*, *Reactions*, and *Free Actions*.

#### Major Action (🔷)

You can only take three Major Action per turn. You can only take Major Actions during your own turn. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use '🔷'. Almost all abilities use one or more *Major Actions*.

#### Free Action (◻️)

You can take any number of *Free Actions* per turn, so long as you meet the condition(s) required to use them. You can also take *Free Actions* on other creatures' turns during encounters, again provided you meet the condition(s) to use them. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use a ◻️. Many abilities also use a *Free Action*.

#### Reaction (⚡)

You can only take one *Reaction* per round. You can take your *Reaction* on any creature's turn, provided you meet the condition to use it. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use '⚡'. Many abilities also use your *Reaction*.

#### Passive Effect (♾️)

Passive effects do not require any *Action* to use. Instead, they apply their effects passively.

### Replacing Action Types

Some abilities replace the type of *Action* an ability uses (e.g. the Rogue's "Cunning Action"). For those abilities, the *Action* specified takes the ability's *Action* type, rather than the type it normally does.

> ### Example
>
> A rogue uses "◻️ - Cunning Action" to "Dash". The rogue doesn't use one of their *Major Actions*, instead, a *Free Action* is used.

### Action Symbols

The following symbols are often used to represent the various kinds of actions an ability uses:
