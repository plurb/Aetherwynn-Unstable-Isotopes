## Actions

### Types of Actions

There are various types of actions you can take. Notably, Major Actions, Minor Actions, Reaction, and Free Actions.

#### Major Action (🔷)

You can only take one Major Action per turn. You can only take Major Actions during your own turn. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use '🔷'. Many abilities also use your Major Action.

Whenever you can take a Major Action (🔷), you may take a Move Action (➡️) instead. However, you cannot replace a Move Action (➡️) with a Major Action (🔷).

#### Minor Action (🔵)

You can only take one Minor Action per turn. You can only take Minor Actions during your own turn. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use '🔵'. Many abilities also use your Minor Action.

#### Free Action (◻️)

You can take any number of Free Actions per turn, so long as you meet the conditions required to use them. You can also take Free Actions on other creatures' turns, provided you meet the condition to use them. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use '◻️'. Many abilities also use a Free Action.

#### Reaction (⚡)

You can only take one Reaction per round. You can take your Reaction on any creature's turn, provided you meet the condition to use it. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use '⚡'. Many abilities also use your Reaction.

#### Passive Effect (♾️)

Passive effects do not require any Action to use. Instead, they apply their effects passively.

#### Attack (🔺)

An *Attack* is a single *Attack* made when you take the "Attack" Action, or make an "Attack of Opportunity". An ability that takes '🔺' replaces one *Attack* you make through the "Attack" Action. You cannot replace an *Attack* made using any abilities other than the "Attack" Action or an "Attack of Opportunity".

#### Move Action (➡️)

You can only take one Move Action per turn. You can only take Move Actions during your own turn. You can take any of the actions listed in [Actions During Encounters][ADE] that use '➡️'. The most common usage of a Move Action are the "Dash" Action and the "Step" Action. Some Move Actions don't use your entire Move Action that turn, instead they only take a part (for example: Taking Cover).

### Replacing Action Types

Some abilities replace the type of Action an Ability uses (e.g. the Rogue's "Cunning Action"). For those abilities, the Action specified takes the ability's Action type, rather than the type it normally does.

> ### Example
>
> A rogue uses "🔵 - Cunning Action" to "Dash". The rogue's Major Action is not used, instead, Their Minor Action is used.

### Action Symbols
