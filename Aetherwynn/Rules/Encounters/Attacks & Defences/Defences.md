# Defences

> ## What are Defences?
>
> *Your defences are your passive ability to ward off harm.*

You have four *Defences*: *AC*, *Reflex*, *Fortitude*, and *Will*.

## Armour Class (AC)

> *Your **AC** represents your ability to ward off conventional weapons. Attacks using a melee/ranged weapon are typically made against your **AC**.*

> ### Wearing Armour
>
> *Many adventurers wear armour to better defend themselves. Wearing armour can change the way your AC is calculated. How the calculation is modified is specified in the armour's item description. This section does not concern itself with items and their consequences.*

Your *AC* is calculated as follows:

`AC = 10 + your Dexterity modifier`

## Reflex

> *Your **Reflex** represents your ability to avoid attacks which occur in an area, are extremely fast, or damage you if you so much as get grazed.*

Your *Reflex* is calculated as follows:

`Reflex = 10 + your Dexterity modifier`

## Fortitude

> *Your **Fortitude** represents your ability to physically resist harm. Attacks which restrain you, attempts to poison you, or forcibly move you, are typically made against your **Fortitude**.*

Your *Fortitude* is calculated as follows:

`Fortitude = 10 + your Constitution modifier`

## Will

> *Your **Will** represents your will over your mind and your body. Attacks which aim to charm you, take control of your mind, or otherwise tamper with your mind, are typically made against your **Will**.*

Your *Will* is calculated as follows:

`Will = 10 + your Wisdom modifier`
