# Encounters & Initiative

## Combat Encounters

### Step 1: Starting A Combat Encounter

When the GM calls, each Player, and each creature participating in combat rolls an *Initiative (Dexterity) Check*. These rolls are then compiled and ordered from greatest to lowest (keep track of who rolled what!). The number rolled is the creature's "Initiative Count".

Combat starts with the creature with the highest "Initiative Count".

### Step 2: Playing A Round of Combat

A round starts with the creature with the highest "Initiative Count". Once that creature has finished taking its turn, then the creature with the next highest "Initiative Count" takes its turn. The round ends when all creatures have finished their turns. When this happens, a new round starts.

(initiative is *not* re-rolled at the start of a round.)

### Step 3: Ending A Combat Encounter

When all hostile creatures are defeated, some sort of truce is reached, or some other event or circumstance ends the combat, the encounter is over. At this point, initiative order is no longer followed (initiative "ends").

## Exploration Encounters

### Step 1: Starting An Exploration Encounter

When the GM calls, each Player, and each creature participating in exploration rolls an *Investigation (Intelligence or Wisdom) Check* or *Perception (Intelligence or Wisdom) Check*. These rolls are then compiled and ordered from greatest to lowest (keep track of who rolled what!). The number rolled is the creature's "Initiative Count".

Combat starts with the creature with the highest "Initiative Count".

### Step 2: Playing A Round of Exploration

A round starts with the creature with the highest Initiative Count. Once that creature has finished taking its turn, then the creature with the next highest Initiative Count takes its turn. The round ends when all creatures have finished their turns. When this happens, a new round starts.

(initiative is *not* re-rolled at the start of a round.)

### Step 3: Ending An Exploration Encounter

An exploration encounter ends when the GM determines that free-play should resume, such as in a peaceful city or town, where the players will not face any present danger. At this point, initiative order is no longer followed (initiative "ends").
