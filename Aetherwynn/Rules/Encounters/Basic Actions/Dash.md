### Dash
*Ability (Basic Action)*  

ðŸ”· â€” You move in a straight line as far as you wish. By default, the maximum distance you can travel is equal to your *Movement Speed*. This *Movement* cannot be broken up by using another action. You may use any of your *Movement Speeds*, but cannot travel farther than the distance specified by the *Movement Speed*.

Some abilities may tell you to `"Dash" X ft.`, in this case, perform the above, except the distance travelled is the distance specified. You may use any of your *Movement Speeds* to "Dash" this way.
