### Arrest A Fall
*Ability (Basic Action)*

⚡ **(requires: you have a *Flying Speed* greater than `0` ft.)** — If you would fall `10` or more ft., make an *Acrobatics (Strength or Dexterity, your choice) Check*. The *DC* is determined using the table below, or by the GM under conditions outside those listed below.

**Success:** Your fall stops after `10` ft.
**Failure:** You continue to fall.
