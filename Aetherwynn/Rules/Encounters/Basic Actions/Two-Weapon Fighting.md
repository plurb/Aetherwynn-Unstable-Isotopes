### Two-Weapon Fighting
*Ability (Basic Action)*  

When you "Attack" and make a *Melee Weapon Attack* using a Weapon with the "Light" property that you are wielding in one hand, you may use a "ðŸ”µ" to make a *Melee Weapon Attack* using a different "Melee Weapon" with the "Light" property that you are wielding in another hand.

If either Weapon has the "Thrown" property, you may make a *Throw Weapon Attack* using the Weapon, instead of making a *Melee Weapon Attack* with it.
