### Off-Hand Attack
*Ability (Basic Action)*  

ðŸ”µ â€” When you "Attack" and make a *Melee Weapon Attack* using a "Weapon" that you are wielding in one hand, you may make a *Melee Weapon Attack* using a different "Melee Weapon" with the "Light" property that you are wielding in another hand.

If either "Weapon" has the "Thrown" property, you may make a *Throw Weapon Attack* using the Weapon, instead of making a *Melee Weapon Attack* with it.
