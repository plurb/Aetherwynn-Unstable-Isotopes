## Turns

A creature's turn is when it acts during an encounter. During its turn, a creature can take three *Major Actions* (üî∑), any number of *Free Actions* (‚óªÔ∏è), and potentially *Reactions* (‚ö°). See [Actions] for more information.

Taking your turn can be split into 4 steps.

### Start of Turn

1. If you are *[Dying]*, roll a *Survival (Constitution) Check*, then end your turn (skip the Upkeep and Main steps).
2. You may use 1 '‚óªÔ∏è' that occurs when your turn begins.
3. Any non-optional effects that occur at the start of your turn occur.

### Upkeep

1. If you caused an effect that has a duration greater than Instantaneous, then reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. If the remaining duration is 0, the effect ends.
2. You regain your Reaction, Major Action, Minor Action, and Movement.

If you haven't spent your reaction from your last turn, you do not gain another one. You cannot "save" Actions/Reactions from one turn to use during the next turn.

### Main Step

You can take three *Major Actions* (üî∑), and any number of *Free Actions* (‚óªÔ∏è). You can take these *Actions* in any order. You can even take *Reactions* (‚ö°), provided you meet the conditions to use one. See [Actions] for more information.

### End of Turn

1. End any effects that end at the end of your turn.
2. You may use 1 Free Action that occurs when your turn ends.
3. Any non-optional effects that occur at the end of your turn occur.
