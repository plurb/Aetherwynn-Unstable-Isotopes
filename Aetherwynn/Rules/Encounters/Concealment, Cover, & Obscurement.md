## Concealment, Cover, & Obscurement

### Concealed

A creature that is *Concealed* cannot be seen. They cannot be targetted by abilities requiring sight, unless the creature using the ability can somehow see them.

### Levels of Cover

There are four levels of cover. Cover is determined by the visibility of the creature from another creature's perspective, or from the origin of an *Attack*/ability. Cover is only applied when the creature is covered by solid objects, such as walls/doors/window sills/sand bags.

In order of least to greatest cover:

**No Cover.** The creature is fully visible.

**Half Cover.** At least half, but less than three-quarters of the creature is covered. The creature gains a `+2` bonus to its *AC* and against *Attacks* vs. *Reflex*.

**Three-Quarters Cover.** At least three quarters, but not the entire creature is covered. The creature gains a `+5` bonus to its *AC* and against *Attacks* vs. *Reflex*.

**Full Cover.** The creature is completely covered. The creature is *Concealed.* The creature is unaffected by *Attacks* vs. *Reflex* made against it.

> ### Examples of Cover
>
> A low wall, a piece of furniture, the hood of a car, a narrow tree trunk, or waist-high water, are all *Half Cover*.
>
> A portcullis, an arrow-slit, a thick tree trunk, or a ledge being viewed from almost directly below, are all *Three-Quarters Cover*.
>
> A solid wall, the inside of a car/carriage, or a wall of force, are all *Full Cover*.

### Levels of Obscurement

There are four levels of obscurement. Obscurement is determined by the visibility within the environment. Foliage, fog, light/darkness, smog, precipitation, cloud cover, or any other type of visual obstruction caused obscurement.

In order of least to greatest obscurement:

**No Obscurement.** Full visibility.

**Lightly Obscured.** The area is obscured enough to cause some difficulty judging the exact shape of objects, but they remain visible. Creatures have *Disadvantage* on *Perception* and *Investigation Checks* requiring sight in areas the area.

**Heavily Obscured.** The area is obscured enough to cause extreme difficulty seeing, however sight is still possible within a limited distance. The area that is within sight in the area is treated as *Lightly Obscured*, beyond that range, everything in the area is *Concealed*.

**Completely Obscured.** The area is completely obscured, making sight impossible. Everything in the area is *Concealed*.
