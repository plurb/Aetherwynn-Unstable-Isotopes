### Attacks

To make an *Attack*, roll a `d20`, then add any appropriate modifiers to the roll, then, the target of the *Attack* compares the total to the specified *DC*. If the total meets or exceeds the *DC*, then the *Attack* "Hits", otherwise, the *Attack* "Misses". The effects that occur when the *Attack* "Hits" or "Misses" are specified by the ability that called for the *Attack*.
