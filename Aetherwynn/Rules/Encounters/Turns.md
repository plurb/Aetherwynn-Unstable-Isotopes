## Turns

A creature's turn is when it acts during an encounter. During its turn, a creature can take a Major Action (🔷), a Minor Action (🔵), a Move Action (➡️), any number of Free Actions (◻️), and potentially reactions (⚡). See [Actions] for more information.

Taking your turn can be split into 4 steps.

### Start of Turn

1. If you are *[Dying]*, roll a *Survival (Constitution) Check*, then end your turn (skip the Upkeep and Main steps).
2. You may use 1 Free Action that occurs when your turn begins.
3. If a non-optional effect occurs at the start of your turn, it occurs.

### Upkeep

1. If you caused an effect that has a duration greater than Instantaneous, then reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. If the remaining duration is 0, the effect ends.
2. You regain your Reaction, Action, Bonus Action, and Movement.

If you haven't spent your reaction from your last turn, You cannot "save" Actions from one turn to use during the next turn.

### Main Step

You can take 1 Major Action (🔷), 1 Minor Action (🔵), 1 Move Action (➡️), and any number of Free Actions (◻️). You can take these Actions in any order. You can even take Reactions (⚡), provided you meet the conditions to use one. See [Actions] for more information.

### End of Turn

1. End any effects that end at the end of your turn.
2. You may use 1 Free Action that occurs when your turn ends.
3. If a non-optional effect occurs at the end of your turn, it occurs.
