## Concentrating

Some abilities require you to maintain Concentration in order to keep their effects active. If you lose Concentration, such an ability ends.

If an ability must be maintained with Concentration, that fact appears in its Requirements (or Components) entry, and the ability's Duration specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end Concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with Concentration. The following factors can break Concentration:

* **Using another ability that requires Concentration** — You lose Concentration on an ability if you cast another ability that requires Concentration. Generally, you cannot concentrate on two abilities at once.

* **Maintaining concentration** — Whenever a creature *Attacks* you while you are Concentrating, if the *Attack Roll* is greater than or equal to your *Fortitude*, your Concentration ends.

* **Being incapacitated or killed** — You lose Concentration on an ability if you are Incapacitated or Die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you are on a storm-tossed ship, in which case the GM rolls an *Attack* vs. your *Fortitude*.
