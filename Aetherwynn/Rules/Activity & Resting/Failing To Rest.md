# Failing To Rest

> *The body needs rest to survive. If an adventurer goes too long without properly resting, they not only risk being unable to perform their best, but death.*

## Failing To Take Long Rests

You need to take a *Long Rest* at least once per day. If you do not take a long rest, then make a *DC* `X` *Constitution Check*, where `X = 10 + the number of days you have gone without a Long Rest`.

## Failing To Take Full Rests

There are no consequences for not taking *Full Rests* for extended periods of time.
