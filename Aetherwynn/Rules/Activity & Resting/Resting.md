# Resting

## Short Rest

You complete a *Short Rest* after either 1 hour of doing nothing but *Light Activity*, or by finishing 10 minutes with *No Activity*.

## Long Rest

You complete a *Long Rest* after 8 hours of *No Activity*, where at least 7 hours are spent *Asleep*. Completing a *Long Rest* counts as completing a *Short Rest* as well.

When you take a *Long Rest*, you may expend any number of your *Hit Dice*. You recover `the number rolled on the die + your Constitution modifier` *HP* for each die you expend.

## Full Rest

You complete a *Full Rest* after 24 hours of only *No Activity* or *Light Activity*, where at least 8 hours are spent *Asleep*. Completing a *Full Rest* counts as completing a *Long Rest* as well.

When you take a *Full Rest*, you recover up to `X` *Hit Dice*, where `X = your Constitution modifier`.
