## Summoned Creatures

Certain spells summon creatures from different planes. These spells take a creature from a different plane and transport them to the plane you are currently on.

A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell that summoned it ends. Additionally, the creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
