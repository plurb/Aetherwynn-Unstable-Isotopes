# Attacks

> ## What is An Attack?
>
> *An attack is a single attempt made to harm a resisting creature. This can take the form of a warrior jockeying to strike their opponent with a blade, a mage unleashing a fireball against a band of goblins, or a spike trap against a falling adventurer.*

## Types of Attacks

There are three major types of attack:
* **Environmental Attacks**
* **Melee Attacks**
* **Ranged Attacks**

And four common subtypes of attacks:
* **Exploit Attacks** - Attacks made using [exploits].
* **Spell Attacks** - Attacks made using [spells].
* **Thrown Attacks** - A special type of ranged attack.
* **Weapon Attacks** - Attacks made using a [weapon].

## Making An Attack

Whenever an attack is made, it is always structured as: "Make an *Attack* vs. *DC*", where *Attack* and *DC* refer to the specific type of *Attack* you are making, and *DC* refering to the *Defence* the *Attack* is being made against. *(For more information on defences, see: [defences])*

Making an attack is split into `X` steps:
1. **Select A Target.** - Select a target within the range of the *Attack*.
2. **The "Attack Roll."** - Roll a `d20`, then add any appropriate modifiers to the roll, then, the target of the *Attack* compares the total to the specified *DC*.
3. **Determine Success.** - If the total meets or exceeds the *DC*, then the *Attack* "Succeeds", otherwise, the *Attack* "Fails".
4. **Apply Effects.** - The effects that occur when the *Attack* "Succeeds" or "Fails" are specified by the *Ability* that called for the *Attack*.

### Making Multiple Attacks

Sometimes, you will make multiple attacks at once (such as through "Multiattack" or a "Barage"). In these cases, you follow the following process for the attacks:
1. **Select Targets.** - Select the targets of all the *Attacks*.
2. **Make All "Attack Rolls".** - Make an *Attack Roll* for each *Attack*.
3. **Determine Success.** - Determing if each *Attack* "Succeeds" or "Fails".
4. **Apply Effects.** - Apply the effects to the specified target of each *Attack* based on whether that *Attack* "Succeeded" or "Failed".

## Environmental Attacks

> *Environmental attacks are made by objects from the environment. Traps, weather, falling debris, or any avoidable/resistable environmental effect constitutes an environmental attack. Environmental attacks are generally made by the GM.*

When making an *Environmental Attack*, roll an *Attack Roll* with the modifier specified under *To Hit*, then apply the effects depending on a "Success" or "Failure".

## Melee Attacks

If you make a *Melee Attack* against a creature outside of the range of the *Attack*, the *Attack* misses and does not apply any effects to the target.

**Unarmed Melee Attacks.** You add your Strength modifier to the `d20` roll.

**Melee Weapon Attacks.** You add your Strength modifier to the `d20` roll.

**Melee Spell Attacks.** You add your Spellcasting modifier to the `d20` roll.

---

## Ranged Attacks

You have *Disadvantage* on *Ranged Attacks* against creatures within 5 ft. of you.

**Ranged Weapon Attacks.** You add your Dexterity modifier to the `d20` roll.

**Thrown Weapon Attacks.** You add your Strength modifier to the `d20` roll.

**Ranged Spell Attacks.** You add your Spellcasting modifier to the `d20` roll.

## Exploit Attacks

*Exploit Attacks*, *Melee Exploit Attacks*, and *Ranged Exploit Attacks* are all *Exploit Attacks*.

## Weapon Attacks

*Melee Weapon Attacks*, *Thrown Weapon Attacks*, and *Ranged Weapon Attacks* are all *Weapon Attacks*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> "Unarmed Strikes" are *Melee Attacks*, but aren't always *Melee **Weapon** Attacks*. The "Monk" class, as well as the "Unarmed Fighting" fighting style explicitly make your "Unarmed Strikes" *Melee Weapons*, meaning those **are** *Melee Weapon Attacks*.

## Spell Attacks

*Spell Attacks*, *Melee Spell Attacks*, and *Ranged Spell Attacks* are all *Spell Attacks*.
