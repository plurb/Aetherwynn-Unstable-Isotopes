# Exploits

# What is an Exploit?

Any ability marked as an "Exploit" is an "Exploit".

## Exploit Level

Every "Exploit" has a "Level" from 1 to 5. An "Exploit's" level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with 1st level being the weakest and 5th level being the strongest. The higher an Exploit's level, the higher level a martial must be to use that spell.

Exploit level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 5th level, to perform a 5th level Exploit.

## Known Exploits

> *Before a martial can perform an Exploit, they must have the Exploit firmly fixed in their muscle memory. Members of a few classes have a limited list of Exploits they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many martial enemies.*

You have a list of "Exploits" you "Know". In order to "Perform an Exploit", the "Exploit" must be in the list of "Exploits" you "Know", and must be of a "Level" less than your "Max Exploit Level".

The number of "Exploits" you "Know", and your "Max Exploit Level" are determined by your "Class" and your "Class Level" in that "Class".

## Costs

> *Performing an exploit takes a toll on the warrior's body.*

Before you "Perform an Exploit", you must pay all costs associated with "Performing" the "Exploit". These costs are under the "Costs" section in the "Exploit's" description.

## Overdrive

> *Warriors can push past ordinary limits and perform their exploits at a higher level.*

As you pay the costs to "Perform an Exploit", you may pay the additional costs specified in the "Overdrive" section in the "Exploit's" description any number of times. Each time you do, you increase the "Exploit's" "Level" by `1`. You cannot increase an "Exploit's" "Level" above your "Max Exploit Level" this way.

## Tempo

> *Performing an exploit takes a certain amount of time, depending on how quickly a warrior is typically able to perform that exploit.*

The type of *Action* used when you "Perform an Exploit" is specified in the "Tempo" section in the description of the "Exploit" you wish to "Perform".

"Exploits" can use the following types of *Action*:
* üî∑ - *Major Action*.
* üîµ - *Minor Action*.
* üî∫ - *Attack*.
* ‚û°Ô∏è - *Move Action*.
* ‚óªÔ∏è - *Free Action*.
* ‚ö° - *Reaction*.

"Exploits" are never *Passive Abilities*.

## Range

"Exploits" have a specific range. The "Range" of an "Exploit" is specified in the "Range" section in the "Exploit's" description.

"Exploits" can have a range as follows:
* Self - The "Exploit" applies its effects to you.
* Self (`X` ft. cone/cube/line/sphere) - The "Exploit" creates the specified type of *Area of Effect*, either originating from or centered on you (see the "Exploit's" description).
* Touch - The "Exploit" affects something you are touching, or can touch.
* `X` ft. - The "Exploit" affects something up to the specified distance away.
* Sight - The "Exploit" affects something within sight.

## Requirements

You must meet all of the "Exploit's" requirements before you "Perform" the "Exploit". The requirements of an "Exploit" are specified in the "Requirements" section in the "Exploit's" description.

## Duration

## Stamina

Regardless of how many Exploits a martial knows, they can only perform a limited number of spells before resting. Moving at superhuman speeds and performing feats of legendary strength is tiring, especially for higher level Exploits. That is why each class capable of performing Exploits tells you how many Stamina Points they have.

A martial typically has a number of stamina points equal to their Constitution modifier + their Martial Level.

See *Multiclassing* for a guide on calculating a character's Martial Level.

# Performing an Exploit

When a character performs any exploit, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the Exploit's effects.

Each Exploit description begins with a block of information, including the Exploit's Name, Level, Tempo, Range, Materials, and Duration. The rest of a Exploit entry describes the Exploit's effect.

## Tempo
Exploits may require an Attack, a Reaction, a Bonus Action, an entire Action, or even longer to perform.

### Free Action
Exploits requiring a Free Action are especially swift, and happen in a single motion.

If an Exploit that modifies an attack deals damage, the damage is always the same type as the weapon used to perform the attack. If the weapon deals multiple damage types, then the damage type is one of the player's choice from among the types that the weapon deals.

### Attack

Exploits requiring an attack enhance or modify the way you attack. An Exploit requiring a single attack replaces an attack you make.

Certain Exploits may require more than one attack. These exploits replace the number of attacks specified, at the point in time specified.

### Bonus Actions
An Exploit with a Tempo of a Bonus Action require a single Bonus Action to perform, provided you are able to take a Bonus Action and haven't taken a Bonus Action on your turn.

### Reactions

Some exploits can be performed as a reaction. These Exploits take a fraction of a second to bring about and are performed in response to some event. If an Exploit can be performed as a reaction, the Exploit's description tells you exactly when you can do so.

## Range

The target of an Exploit must be within the Exploit's range. Exploits can target creatures or points within their range. Whether an Exploit targets a creature or a point is specified in the Exploit's description.

An Exploit that has a range of "Self" either modifies an attack you perform, or creates an Area of Effect that originates from you like a Cone or Line.

Once an Exploit is performed, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the Exploit's description says otherwise.

## Materials
Some Exploits require specific items to perform them (such as ammunition, a specific type of weapon, or a shield). You must be holding the materials required for an Exploit to perform it.

If an Exploit states that it consumes its materials, then those materials are used up and cannot be re-used, unless the Exploit says otherwise.

If you are not holding an Exploit's Materials, you must have a free hand to access them.

## Duration
An Exploit's duration is the length of time the Exploit persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some Exploits specify that their effects last until the spells are undone or their results destroyed/repaired.

### Instantaneous
Many Exploits are instantaneous. The Exploit  harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be interupted, because itis performed in an instant.

### Concentration
Some Exploits require you to concentrate to maintain their effects. You are [concentrating] as long as the effects of the Exploit persist.

## Targets
A typical Exploit requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the Exploit. An Exploit's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

## Saving Throws
Many Exploits specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your Exploits equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.
