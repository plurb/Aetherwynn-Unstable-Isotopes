# Exploits

# What is an Exploit?

Any ability marked as an "Exploit" is an "Exploit".

## Exploit Level

Every "Exploit" has a "Level" from 1 to 5. An "Exploit's" level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with 1st level being the weakest and 5th level being the strongest. The higher an Exploit's level, the higher level a martial must be to use that spell.

Exploit level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 5th level, to perform a 5th level Exploit.

## Known Exploits

> *Before a martial can perform an Exploit, they must have the Exploit firmly fixed in their muscle memory. Members of a few classes have a limited list of Exploits they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many martial enemies.*

You have a list of "Exploits" you "Know". In order to "Perform an Exploit", the "Exploit" must be in the list of "Exploits" you "Know", and must be of a "Level" less than your "Max Exploit Level".

The number of "Exploits" you "Know", and your "Max Exploit Level" are determined by your "Class" and your "Class Level" in that "Class".

## Costs

> *Performing an exploit takes a toll on the warrior's body.*

Before you "Perform an Exploit", you must pay all costs associated with "Performing" the "Exploit". These costs are under the "Costs" section in the "Exploit's" description.

## Overdrive

> *Warriors can push past ordinary limits and perform their exploits at a higher level.*

As you pay the costs to "Perform an Exploit", you may pay the additional costs specified in the "Overdrive" section in the "Exploit's" description any number of times. Each time you do, you increase the "Exploit's" "Level" by `1`. You cannot increase an "Exploit's" "Level" above your "Max Exploit Level" this way.

## Tempo

> *Performing an exploit takes a certain amount of time, depending on how quickly a warrior is typically able to perform that exploit.*

The type of *Action* used when you "Perform an Exploit" is specified in the "Tempo" section in the description of the "Exploit" you wish to "Perform".

"Exploits" can use the following types of *Action*:
* üî∑ - *Major Action*.
* üî∑ - *Minor Action*.
* üî∫ - *Attack*.
* üî∑ - *Move Action*.
* ‚óªÔ∏è - *Free Action*.
* ‚ö° - *Reaction*.

"Exploits" are never *Passive Abilities*.

## Range

"Exploits" have a specific range. The "Range" of an "Exploit" is specified in the "Range" section in the "Exploit's" description.

"Exploits" can have a range as follows:
* Self - The "Exploit" applies its effects to you.
* Self (`X` ft. cone/cube/line/sphere) - The "Exploit" creates the specified type of *Area of Effect*, either originating from or centred on you (see the "Exploit's" description).
* Touch - The "Exploit" affects something you are touching, or can touch.
* `X` ft. - The "Exploit" affects something up to the specified distance away.
* Sight - The "Exploit" affects something within sight.

## Areas of Effect

Some "Exploits" create *Areas of Effect*. For more information, see: ["Areas of Effect"][AOE].

## Requirements

You must meet all of the "Exploit's" requirements before you "Perform" the "Exploit". The requirements of an "Exploit" are specified in the "Requirements" section in the "Exploit's" description.

### Concentration

Some "Exploits" require "Concentration". You cannot perform an "Exploit" that requires "Concentration" if you are already "Concentrating".

## Duration

"Exploits" have a duration that specifies how long the effects of the "Exploit" last. The duration of an "Exploit" are specified in the "Duration" section in the "Exploit's" description.

An "Exploit" can have one of the following durations:
* Instantaneous - The effects of the "Exploit" happen instantaneously.
* `X` rounds - The effects last that many rounds, or `6X` seconds outside of encounters.
* `X` minutes - The effects last that many minutes.
* Concentration, ... - The effects lasts the duration, during which you are "Concentrating".
