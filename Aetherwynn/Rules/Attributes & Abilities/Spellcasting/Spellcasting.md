# Spellcasting

## What is an Spell?

Any ability marked as an "Spell" is an "Spell".

---

## Spell Level

Every "Spell" has a "Level" from 1 to 9. An "Spell's" level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with 1st level being the weakest and 9th level being the strongest. The higher an Spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 5th level, to perform a 9th level "Spell".

## Known Spells

> *Before a martial can perform an Spell, they must have the Spell firmly fixed in their muscle memory. Members of a few classes have a limited list of Spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many martial enemies.*

You have a list of "Spells" you "Know". In order to "Cast a Spell", the "Spell" must be in the list of "Spells" you "Know", and must be of a "Level" less than your "Max Spell Level".

The number of "Spells" you "Know", and your "Max Spell Level" are determined by your "Class" and your "Class Level" in that "Class".

## Costs

> *Performing an exploit takes a toll on the warrior's body.*

Before you "Cast a Spell", you must pay all costs associated with "Performing" the "Spell". These costs are under the "Costs" section in the "Spell's" description.

---

## Empowering Spells

> *Warriors can push past ordinary limits and perform their exploits at a higher level.*

As you pay the costs to "Cast a Spell", you may pay the additional costs specified in the "Empower" section in the "Spell's" description any number of times. Each time you do, you increase the "Spell's" "Level" by `1`. You cannot increase an "Spell's" "Level" above your "Max Spell Level" this way.

## Casting Time
3
> *Performing an exploit takes a certain amount of time, depending on how quickly a warrior is typically able to perform that exploit.*

The type of *Action* used when you "Cast a Spell" is specified in the "Casting Time" section in the description of the "Spell" you wish to "Cast".

"Spells" can have the following "Casting Times":
* üî∑ to üî∑üî∑üî∑
* üî∫
* ‚óªÔ∏è
* ‚ö°
* ‚è≥ **X rounds/minutes/hours/etc.** - The "Spell" takes the specified amount of time to cast.

"Spells" are never *Passive Abilities*, however a "Spell" may grant you a passive ability temporarily.

---

## Range

"Spells" have a specific range. The "Range" of an "Spell" is specified in the "Range" section in the "Spell's" description.

"Spells" can have a range as follows:
* Self - The "Spell" applies its effects to you.
* Self (`X` ft. cone/cube/line/sphere) - The "Spell" creates the specified type of *Area of Effect*, either originating from or centred on you (see the "Spell's" description).
* Touch - The "Spell" affects something you are touching, or can touch.
* `X` ft. - The "Spell" affects something up to the specified distance away.
* Sight - The "Spell" affects something within sight.

## Areas of Effect

Some "Spells" create *Areas of Effect*. For more information, see: ["Areas of Effect"][AOE].

## Components

### Concentration (C)

Some "Spells" require "Concentration". You cannot perform a "Spell" that requires "Concentration" if you are already "Concentrating".

### Verbal (V)

To cast a "Spell" with a "Verbal" component, you must be able to speak.

### Somatic (S)

To cast a "Spell" with a "Somatic" component, you must have at least one free hand.

### Material (M)

<!-- TODO: as terms are defined, reference them here. -->

To cast a "Spell" with a "Material" component, you must either be wielding a "Spellcasting Focus" you are *Proficient* with, or you must have all the listed materials equipped. If the component has a specified monetary cost, then you must have the item equipped, even if you are wielding a "Spellcasting Focus".

---

## Duration

"Spells" have a duration that specifies how long the effects of the "Spell" last. The duration of an "Spell" are specified in the "Duration" section in the "Spell's" description.

An "Spell" can have one of the following durations:
* Instantaneous - The effects of the "Spell" happen instantaneously.
* `X` rounds - The effects last that many rounds, or `6X` seconds outside of encounters.
* `X` minutes - The effects last that many minutes.
* Concentration, ... - The effects last the duration, as long as you are "Concentrating". If you stop "Concentrating", the "Spell" ends.
