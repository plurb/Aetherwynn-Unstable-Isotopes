## Replicating A Spell

Some abilities may tell you to "replicate a "Spell"". This means casting the "Spell" as if you were the caster, regardless of whether you know or have the "Spell" prepared, and without spending any of the "Spell's" costs. The "Spell" you cast this way is cast at the same level of the replicated spell.
