# Abilities

## Parsing Abilities

Abilities will usually look like this:

> ### The Ability Name
> *The ability's tags*  
> **Pre-requisites:** If the ability has pre-requisites, they will be listed here.
>
> > *The ability's flavour text. This is descriptive text that has no effect on gameplay other than the ability's description.*
>
> [The activation time] **(any limits on frequency, any special requirements, the ability's range, the duration, or special modifiers)** — The effects of the ability.
>
> **Success:** If the effects required a roll, then the effects on a success are described here.
> **Failure:** If there are any special effects upon a failed roll, they are described here. If nothing occurs, then this section is omitted.

## Tags

Tags are additional descriptors for abilities. Tags do not directly affect how an ability behaves, however they *do* affect how other abilities interact with the ability. Always make sure to read the ability's tags.

## Pre-requisites

These are conditions that your character must meet before they are able to obtain the ability. Pre-requisites may be a number of levels in a certain class, having already obtained a certain feat, being a certain race, or having certain values for your ability scores.

## Activation Time

An ability's activation time states how long it takes to use the ability. The activation time is typically stated as a number of *Actions* (🔷 to 🔷🔷🔷), a *Free Action* (◻️), a *Reaction* ⚡, an *Attack* (🔷), or a span of time (⏳ X rounds/minutes/hours/etc.). For more information, see [actions][A] in "Encounters".
