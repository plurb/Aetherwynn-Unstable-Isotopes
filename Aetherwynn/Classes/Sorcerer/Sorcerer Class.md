## Spellcasting

<!-- TODO: complete sorcerer spellcasting -->

### Spellcasting Ability

> *Your spellcasting is an extension of your being, and is driven by your emotions and will. Your spellcasting is directly proportional to your ability to express your will.*

If one of your "Spells" requires you to make a *Spell Attack*, or a creature to make a *Check*, your "Spell Attack Modifier", and "Spell DC" are calculated as follows:

**Spell Attack Modifier** = `your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`  
**Spell DC** = `10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`

**Stamina Points** = `your Sorcerer Level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0)`

You regain all expended "Stamina Points" when you finish a *Short* or *Long Rest*.

### Using Metamagic

You can use only one "Metamagic" option on a "Spell" when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
