# Arcane Trickster

## Unliscensed Spellcasting
*3rd-level Ability (Rogue, Arcane Trickster Archetype, Spellcasting)*

> *You are able to channel the aether which naturally exists in the world.*

See [**spellcasting**][SP] for the general rules of spellcasting and the ["Arcane Trickster Spell List"][ATSL] for the Green Warden Spell List.

### Cantrips

You know a number of *Cantrips* equal to the number shown in the "Cantrips" column of the "Green Warden Spellcasting" table.

### Spells Known & Casting Spells

> *You instinctively know a set of spells.*

The "Green Warden Spellcasting" table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your "Green Warden Spells" of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a *Full Rest*.

You know a number of spells as shown in the "Spells Known" column of the "Green Warden Spellcasting" table. (You can only cast Spells that you know.)

### Spellcasting Ability

> *You channel your magic through instinct and intuition.*

You use your Intelligence whenever a Spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when calculating the *DC* for an Arcane Trickster Spell you cast and when making an *Attack Roll* with one.

**Spell DC** = `10 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`
**Spell Attack Modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`
