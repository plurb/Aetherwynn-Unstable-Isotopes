## Starting Equipment

---

## Multiclassing

---

## Sneak Attack
*1st-level Ability (Rogue)*

> *You exploit a target's weakness, and land a decisive strike.*

◻️ **(1/turn)** — When you hit a creature using a Finesse Weapon or a *Ranged Weapon Attack*, you deal additional Damage equal to your "Sneark Attack" dice.

---

## Fighting Style
*1st-level Ability (Rogue)*

You learn one fighting style from [*Rogue Fighting Styles*][RF].

---

## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Rogue)*

> *{Rogue exploit flavour text.}*

You gain the following attributes and abilities.

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere common crook, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary individual.*

You have a number of "Stamina Points" calculated as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Rogue level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0)`

To perform an Exploit, you expend a number of "Stamina Points" equal to the Exploit's level. You regain all expended "Stamina Points" when you finish a *Short* or *Long Rest*.

For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, or *Ability Check*: you can only use one Exploit per *Attack*, or *Ability Check*.

### Exploits Known

You learn three Exploits from the *[Rogue Exploit List][REL]*. The "Exploits Known" column of the Rogue table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn an Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level (as shown in the "Exploit Level" column of the Barbarian table), as well as meet any other pre-requisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the *[Rogue Exploit List][REL]*.

### Exploit Ability

If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make an *Ability Check*, your Exploit DC is calculated as follows:

**Exploit Save DC** = `10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier`
