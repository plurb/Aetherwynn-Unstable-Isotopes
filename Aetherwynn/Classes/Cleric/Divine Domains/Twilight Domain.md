## Watchful Gaze
*1st-level Ability (Cleric, Twilight Domain)*

> *You can see through the deepest gloom.*

<!-- 
You have darkvision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

As an action, you can magically share the darkvision of this feature with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). The shared darkvision lasts for 1 hour. Once you share it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to share it again.

## Twilight Vigil
*1st-level Ability (Cleric, Twilight Domain)*

> *The night has taught you to be vigilant.*

<!-- As an action, you give one creature you touch (including possibly yourself) advantage on the next initiative roll the creature makes. This benefit ends immediately after the roll or if you use this feature again. -->
