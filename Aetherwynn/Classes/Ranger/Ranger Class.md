## Hunter's Mark
*1st-level Ability (Ranger)*  

‚ôæÔ∏è ‚Äî You have `X` *Charges* of "Hunter's Mark", where `X = 1` at 1st-level in this class, `X = 2` at 9th-level in this class, `X = 3` at 13th-level in this class, and `X = 4` at 17th-level in this class. You regain all expended *Charges* whenever you finish a *Short Rest*.

‚óªÔ∏è **(1/turn, range: 120 ft., duration: 1 hour)** ‚Äî You may expend `1` *Charge* of "Hunter's Mark". If you do, *Mark* target creature you can see or hear in range. Until this ability ends, you gain the following effects:
* Whenever you hit the *Marked* creature with a *Weapon Attack*, you deal an additional `1dH` *Damage* of the "Weapon's" *Damage Type*, where `H = the size of the die in the "Hunter's Mark" column of the "Ranger" table`.
* You have *Advantage* on *Perception*, and *Survival Checks* to "Search" for the *Marked* creature.

If the *Marked* creature is reduced to `0` HP before this Ability ends, you can use a '‚óªÔ∏è' on your turn to mark another target creature you can see or hear in range. You can only *Mark* one creature this way at a time.
