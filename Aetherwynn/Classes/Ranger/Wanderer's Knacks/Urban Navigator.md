### Urban Navigator
*Wanderer's Knack (Ranger)*

♾️ — Whenever you are in an urban area (such as a city or town), you are able to:
* Find accomodations (such as a tavern, a hotel, or safe house) suitable for your group.
* Find NPCs capable of aiding you and your group (such as a blacksmith, crime lord, or local noble). The NPC, their behaviour, demands, and conditions of aid are up to the GM.
