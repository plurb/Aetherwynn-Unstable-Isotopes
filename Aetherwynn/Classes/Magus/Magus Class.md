<!--

you learn to blend arcane spells and martial skills as only a Magi can. As a bonus action, you can imbue a Magus spell of 1st-level or higher into an Arcane Armory weapon you touch until the start of your next turn, so long as it meets the requirements below:

The spell must have a casting time of 1 action. The spell must require a single attack roll, force a target to make a saving throw, or affect a total number of hit points worth of creatures. If you hit a target with the imbued weapon before the beginning of your next turn, you can expend a spell slot to cast the imbued spell as part of that attack, causing the target to become the target of both the imbued spell and the damage of your attack. The spell is instantly cast and immediately takes effect at the level of the spell slot you spent, with the following changes:

Area of Effect. If the spell would normally target an area greater than a 5-foot cube, it either takes effect as a 15-foot cone originating from you, which must include your target, or it is contained to only effect the target of your attack.

Saving Throws. If the spell requires a saving throw, it makes its saving throw on hit, when the spell is cast. If you score a critical hit, it automatically fails its saving throw.

Spell Attacks. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, it instantly takes effect when you hit with the weapon attack.

Concentration. If the spell requires your concentration, you must concentrate on the spell as soon as it is cast.
