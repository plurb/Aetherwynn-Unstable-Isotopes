## Martial Arts
*1st-level Ability (Monk)*

### Martial Arts Die
*Attribute (Monk, Martial Arts)*  

Your "Martial Arts Die" is a `d6`. It increases at certain levels, as shown in the "Martial Arts" column of the "Monk" table. Some abilities reference this die as `NdM`, where `N = the number of dice` and `M = the size of your "Martial Arts Die"`.

### Martial Arts Attacks

For the purpose of your "Monk" abilities, *Martial Arts Attacks* are *Unarmed Strikes*, or *Attacks* using a *Melee Weapon* you are *Proficient* with without the "Heavy" or "Special" properties.

### Deadly Strikes
*Ability (Monk, Martial Arts)*  

♾️ — Your *Unarmed Strikes* are "Martial Melee Weapons" you are *Proficient* with, and have the "Finesse" property. Their "Damage Die" is `1dM [bludgeoning]`.

♾️ **(1/turn)** — Whenever you "Attack" and make one or more "Martial Arts Attacks", make one additional "Martial Arts Attack".

### Unarmoured Defence
*Ability (Monk, Martial Arts)*  

While not wearing Armour, your *AC* is calculated as follows:

**AC** = `10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier`

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere common soldier, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a number of "Stamina Points" calculated as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Monk Level + your Constitution modifier`

To perform an "Exploit", you must expend a number of "Stamina Points" equal to the "Exploit's" level. You regain your expended "Stamina Points" when you finish a *Short Rest* or a *Long Rest*.

For "Exploits" that modify an *Attack*, or *Check*: you can only use one "Exploit" per *Attack*, or *Check*.

### Exploits Known

You learn `3` "Exploits" from the [*Monk Exploit List*][MEL]. The "Exploits" column of the Monk Table shows when you learn more "Exploits" of your choice. To learn an "Exploit", you must be able to learn "Exploits" of its level, as well as meet any other prerequisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in the "Exploit's" entry).

Whenever you gain a "Monk" level, you can replace one of the "Exploits" you learnt from this class with another "Exploit" from the *Monk Exploit List*.

### Exploit Attacks & Checks

**Exploit Attack Modifier** = `your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier`  
**Exploit DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier`  

---

## Fast Movement
*2nd-level Ability (Monk)*

♾️ — You gain a bonus to your *Movement Speed* equal to the amount shown in the "Fast Movement" column of the Monk Table.

### Ki Attacks & Ki DC
*Attribute*  

<!-- You use your *Wisdom* whenever an ability refers to your Ki Ability. In addition, you use your *Wisdom modifier* when calculating the Saving Throw DC for [Techniques][T] and other Monk Abilities you perform and when making an *Attack Roll* for *Ki Attacks*. -->

**Ki Attack Modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`  
**Ki DC** = `8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`  

### Ki Spells

Ki Spells use your "Ki Attack Modifier" for "Spell Attacks" and your "Ki DC" for their "Spell DC".
