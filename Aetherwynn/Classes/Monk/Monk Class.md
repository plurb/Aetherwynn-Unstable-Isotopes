## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Monk)*  

You begin to learn techniques that enhance your martial skill in and out of battle. You gain the following Abilities:

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere common soldier, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a limited well of stamina represented by a number of Stamina Points. You can calculate the number of Stamina Points you have as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Monk Level + your Constitution modifier`

To perform an Exploit, you must expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain your expended Stamina Points when you finish a *Short Rest* or a *Long Rest*.

For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, *Ability Check*, or *Saving Throw*: you can only use one Exploit per *Attack*, *Ability Check*, or *Saving Throw*.

### Exploits Known

You learn `3` Exploits from the [*Monk Exploit List*][MEL]. The "Exploits" column of the Monk Table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn a Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level, as well as meet any other prerequisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Monk level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the *Monk Exploit List*.

### Saving Throws

If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a *Saving Throw*, the DC is calculated as follows:

**Exploit Save DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier`

---

## Fast Movement
*2nd-level Ability (Monk)*

♾️ — You gain a bonus to your *Movement Speed* equal to the amount shown in the "Fast Movement" column of the Monk Table.

## Ki
*2nd-level Ability (Monk)*

> *You can channel your aura as a mystical energy called 'Ki'.*

You gain the following abilities:

### Ki Points

You have a number of Ki Points calculated as follows:

**Ki Points** = `your Monk level + your Wisdom modifier`

### Ki Abilities

You use your Wisdom whenever an ability refers to your Ki Ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when calculating the Saving Throw DC for [Techniques][T] and other Monk Abilities you perform and when making an *Attack Roll* for *Ki Attacks*.

**Ki Save DC** = `8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`  
**Ki Attack Modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

### Ki Spells

Some Abilities let you cast Spells using Ki. You use your Wisdom whenever a Spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. The *Saving Throw* DC and *Attack Roll* modifier are equal to your Ki Save DC and Ki Attack Modifier.
