### Deflect Missiles
*Technique (Monk)*  
**Pre-requisites:** At least 5th level Monk  

You gain the following abilities:
* ⚡ **(Range 60 ft.)** — If a creature you can see targets you with one or more *Ranged Attacks*, you may spend `X` Ki Points, where `X = any number, up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 0)`. If you do, reduce the damage those *Attacks* deal by `XdM + your Monk level`. For each *Attack*, if the Damage it dealt was reduced to `0` this way, you may make `1` *Ranged Ki Attack* against a creature or object in range, this *Attack* deals the same amount of Damage that the original *Attack* would have dealt to you.
