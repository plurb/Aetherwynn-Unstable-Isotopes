## Fighting Style
*1st-level Ability (Fighter)*  

You learn one Fighting Style from *[Fighter Fighting Styles]*.



You learn additional fighting styles as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Fighter Table.

---

## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Fighter)*  

You begin to learn techniques that enhance your martial skill in and out of battle. You gain the following Abilities:

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere common soldier, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a limited well of stamina represented by a number of Stamina Points. You can calculate the number of Stamina Points you have as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Fighter Level + your Constitution modifier`

To perform an Exploit, you must expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain your expended Stamina Points when you finish a *Short Rest* or a *Long Rest*.

For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, *Ability Check*, or *Saving Throw*: you can only use one Exploit per *Attack*, *Ability Check*, or *Saving Throw*.

<!--
NOTE:

> For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, *Ability Check*, or *Saving Throw*:...

This rule is a side effect of SRD 5.6.2 "Timing". It's only here since it's unlikely a new player has read the SRD.
-->

### Exploits Known

You learn `3` Exploits from the [*Fighter Exploit List*](./Fighter%20Exploit%20List.md). The "Exploits" column of the Fighter Table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn a Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level, as well as meet any other prerequisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Fighter Level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the *Fighter Exploit List*.

### Saving Throws

If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit DC is calculated as follows:

**Exploit Save DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`

---

## Second Wind
*1st-level Ability (Fighter)*  

> *You draw a long and weary breath, steeling your resolve and pushing forwards.*

üîµ **(1/short rest)** ‚Äî You regain `1d10 + X` hp, where `X = your Fighter level`.

If you have no remaining uses of "Second Wind", you can expend `2` *Stamina Points* to use it again.

At 14th level in this class, you can use "Second Wind" **2/short rest** without expending *Stamina Points*.

---

## Action Surge
*2nd-level Ability (Fighter)*  

> *You can momentarily push yourself beyond human limits.*

‚óªÔ∏è **(1/short rest, 1/turn)** ‚Äî You may take 1 additional Major Action this turn. This Action cannot be used to cast a spell.

At 18th level in this class, you can use "Action Surge" **2/short rest**.

---

## Martial Archetype
*3rd-level Ability (Fighter)*

> *You have distinguished yourself from the common warrior, and have gained skills that represent your unique skillset.*

Choose one of the following Martial Archetypes:

| Martial Archetype | Source                  |
| :---------------- | :---------------------- |
| Arcane Knight     | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |

| Legionaire        | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |
| Marksman          | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |

### Archetype Exploits

Each Archetype has a list of Exploits you learn at the Fighter levels noted in the Archetype's description. They do not count against the total number of Exploits you know and cannot be switched out for other Exploits. If you do not meet an Archetype Exploit's pre-requisites, you learn it anyways.

---

## Ability Score Increase
*4th-level Ability (All Classes)*

Increase one Ability Score of your choice by 2, or you increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an Ability Score above 20 using this Ability.

> *You can strike with inhuman speed.*

‚ôæÔ∏è ‚Äî You Attack up to `2` times, instead of once, when you take the *Attack* Action on your turn.
