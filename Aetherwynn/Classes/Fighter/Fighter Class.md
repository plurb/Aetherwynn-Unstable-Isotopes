---

## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Fighter, Exploits)*  

You begin to learn techniques that enhance your martial skill in and out of battle. You gain the following Abilities:

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere common soldier, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a limited well of stamina represented by a number of Stamina Points. You can calculate the number of Stamina Points you have as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Fighter Level + your Constitution modifier`

To perform an Exploit, you must expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain your expended Stamina Points when you finish a *Short Rest* or a *Long Rest*.

For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, or *Ability Check*: you can only use one Exploit per *Attack*, or *Ability Check*.

### Exploits Known

You know `X` Exploits from the *[Fighter Exploit List]*, where `X = the number shown in the "Exploits Known" column of the Fighter table`. To learn a Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level, as well as meet any other prerequisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in the tags of the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Fighter Level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the *Fighter Exploit List*.

### Exploit Ability

If one of your Exploits requires you to make an *Exploit Attack*, or a creature to make a *Check*, your "Exploit Attack Modifier", and "Exploit DC" are calculated as follows:

**Exploit Attack Modifier** = `your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`
**Exploit DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`

---

## Momentary Pause
*1st-level Ability (Fighter)*  

> *You draw a long and weary breath, steeling your resolve and pushing forwards.*

üîµ **(1/long rest)** ‚Äî You regain `X` "Stamina Points", where `X = your Constitution modifier`.

At 14th level in this class, you can use "Momentary Pause" **2/long rest**.

---

## Action Surge
*2nd-level Ability (Fighter)*  

> *You can momentarily push yourself beyond human limits.*

‚óªÔ∏è **(`X`/short rest, 1/turn)** ‚Äî You may take an additional üî∑ this turn. This üî∑ cannot be used to cast a Spell.

Where `X = 1` at 2nd level in the class, and `X = 2` at 18th level in this class.

---

## Martial Archetype
*3rd-level Ability (Fighter)*

> *You have distinguished yourself from the common warrior, and have gained skills that represent your unique skillset.*

Choose one of the following Martial Archetypes:

| Martial Archetype | Source                  |
|:------------------|:------------------------|
| Arcane Knight     | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |

| Marksman          | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |

### Archetype Exploits

Each Archetype has a list of Exploits you learn at the Fighter levels noted in the Archetype's description. They do not count against the total number of Exploits you know and cannot be switched out for other Exploits. If you do not meet an Archetype Exploit's pre-requisites, you learn it anyways.
