## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Barbarian)*

> *You gain savage abilities that help you gore enemies and aid allies in and out of battle.*

You gain the following attributes and abilities.

### Stamina Points

> *You have stamina greater than a mere outcast, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a number of "Stamina Points" calculated as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Barbarian level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0)`

You regain all expended "Stamina Points" when you finish a *Short* or *Long Rest*.

### Exploits Known

You know `X` Exploits from the *[Barbarian Exploit List]*, where `X = the number shown in the "Exploits Known" column of the Barbarian table`. To learn an Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level (as shown in the "Exploit Level" column of the Barbarian table), as well as meet any other pre-requisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in tags of the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one Exploit you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the *[Barbarian Exploit List]*.

To perform an Exploit, you expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, or *Ability Check*: you can only use one Exploit per *Attack*, or *Ability Check*.

### Exploit Ability

If one of your Exploits requires you to make an *Exploit Attack*, or a creature to make a Check, your "Exploit Attack Modifier", and "Exploit DC" are calculated as follows:

**Exploit Attack Modifier** = `+ your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier`
**Exploit DC** = `10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier`
