🔵 **(`X`/short rest, requires: You are not wearing Heavy Armour)** — You are *[Enraged]* until this ability ends. While *[Enraged]* this way, you gain the following effects:
* When you make a *Weapon Attack* using your Strength, you deal additional Damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
* You gain *Resistance* to non-Magical Bludgeoning, non-Magical Piercing, and non-Magical Slashing Damage.

This ability lasts for 10 minutes, and ends early unless you make an *Attack*, Check using Strength, take *Damage*, or use a 🔵 to extend it before the beginning of your next turn.

`X = the number shown in the "Rages" column of the Barbarian table`

---

## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Barbarian)*

> *You gain savage abilities that help you gore enemies and aid allies in and out of battle.*

You gain the following attributes and abilities.

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere outcast, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a number of "Stamina Points" calculated as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Barbarian level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0)`

To perform an Exploit, you expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain all expended Stamina Points when you finish a *Short* or *Long Rest*.

For Exploits that modify an *Attack*, or *Ability Check*: you can only use one Exploit per *Attack*, or *Ability Check*.

### Exploits Known

You know `X` Exploits from the *[Barbarian Exploit List]*, where `X = the number shown in the "Exploits Known" column of the Barbarian table`. To learn an Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level (as shown in the "Exploit Level" column of the Barbarian table), as well as meet any other pre-requisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in tags of the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one Exploit you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the *[Barbarian Exploit List]*.

### Exploit Ability

If one of your Exploits requires you to make an *Exploit Attack*, or a creature to make a Check, your "Exploit Attack Modifier", and "Exploit DC" are calculated as follows:

**Exploit Attack Modifier** = `+ your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier`
**Exploit DC** = `10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier`
