* When you make a *Weapon Attack* using your Strength, you deal additional damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
* You gain *Resistance* to non-Magical Bludgeoning, non-Magical Piercing, and non-Magical Slashing Damage.

## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Barbarian)*

> *You gain savage abilities that help you gore enemies and aid allies in and out of battle.*

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere outcast, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a number of Stamina Points calculated as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Barbarian level + your Constitution modifier` (minimum of 0)

To perform an Exploit, you expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain all expended Stamina Points when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

For Exploits that modify an Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw: you can only use one Exploit per Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw.

### Exploits Known

You learn two Exploits from the Barbarian Exploit List. The Exploits Known column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn an Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level (as shown in the "Exploit Level" column of the Barbarian table), as well as meet any other pre-requisites (listed under **Pre-requisites** in the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the Barbarian Exploit List.

### Exploit Ability

If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a *Saving Throw*, your Exploit DC is calculated as follows:

**Exploit Save DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier`
