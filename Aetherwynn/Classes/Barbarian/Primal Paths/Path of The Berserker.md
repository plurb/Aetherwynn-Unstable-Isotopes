## Frenzy
*3rd-level Ability (Barbarian, Path of The Berserker)*  

> *Your wrath is so vicious, you damage yourself in order to destroy your foes.*

🔷 **(requires: you are [*Enraged*][E])** — You may deal `1d6 [necrotic]` Damage to yourself. If you do, make a *Melee Weapon Attack* vs. *AC* using a "Melee Weapon" you are wielding.

---

## Mindless Rage
*6th-level Ability (Barbarian, Path of The Berserker)*  

♾️ — While you are [*Enraged*][E], you ignore the effects of being *[Charmed]* or *[Frightened]* until you are no longer [*Enraged*][E].

---

## Frightful Presence
*10th-level Ability (Barbarian, Path of The Berserker)*  

◻️ **(1/turn, range: 60 ft.)** — Make a *Melee Exploit Attack* vs. *Will* against any number of other target creatures in range that you can see and can see you.

**Success:** The creature is *Frightened* of you for 1 minute.  
**Failure:** This effect ends for that creature; the creature gains *Immunity* to your "Frightful Pressence" for the next `24` hrs..  

A creature *Frightened* this way makes an *Insight (Wisdom) Check* at the end of each of its turns.

**Success:** The creature is no longer *Frightened*; the creature gains *Immunity* to your "Frightful Pressence" for the next `24` hrs..

> ### Rulings
>
> (07-04-2024) Ignoring the effects is different from being immune to the effects. If you are still charmed/frightened when your rage ends, you feel the effects of being charmed/frightened.
>
> (07-04-2024) You cannot target yourself with "Frightful Presence", as indicated by "*other* target creatures."
