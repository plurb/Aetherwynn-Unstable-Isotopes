## Infused Magic
*1th-level Ability (Aethersmith, Spellcasting)*  

During a *Short Rest*, if you have access to a set of tinker's tools, you can infuse up to `X` items with Aethersmith Spells you know, where `X = Infused Items` which can be found on the class table. The spell infused in the item is called an infused spell.

An item cannot be infused if it is being worn or carried by another creature, is larger than you can hold/wield/carry, or already holds an infused spell.

You can cast an infused spell using its normal casting time, and providing all Verbal and Somatic components. Material components are provided when you infuse the Spell, any consumed Materials are consumed when you infuse the spell. If a spell requires somatic components, you use the item as part of the somatic components allowing you to cast the spell while holding the item.

When you cast a spell infused into an item, the infusion ends.
