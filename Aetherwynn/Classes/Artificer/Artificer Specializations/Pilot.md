PROMPT:

Vehicle artificer. They have a mech (starts as large) that they can add infusions to and their abilities revolves around somewhat (but should work w/ vehicles in general).

As a general idea, the vehicle looks a bit like this:

> ### The Biggun
> *Large Vehicle (Land)*  
>
> **HP** -  
> **AC** -  
>
> ---
> 
> |  STR  |  DEX  |  CON  |
> | :---: | :---: | :---: |
> |   -   |   -   |   -   |

> [things it does]

Note, it looks similar to a creature statblock. That's because it basically is, though the mental stats are omitted cuz... It's an innanimate object.
