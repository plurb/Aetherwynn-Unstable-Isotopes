## Infused Magic

**ROUGH OUTLINE. MECHANICS ARE NOT RIGOROUSLY DEFINED.**

During a *Short Rest*, if you have access to a set of tools you are proficient with, you can infuse up to `X` items with Artificer Spells you know.

You can infuse a number of Spells into objects equal to your number of Infused Items (see: "Infused Items" on the Artificer table). You can cast an infused Spell using its normal casting time, and providing all Verbal and Somatic components. Material components are provided when you infuse the Spell, any consumed Materials are consumed when you infuse the spell.

When you cast a spell infused into an item, the infusion ends.
