---

## Spellcasting
*1st-level Ability (Wizard)*

> *As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.*

See **spellcasting** for the general rules of spellcasting and the [**Wizard Spell List**][WSL] for the Wizard Spell List.

[WSL]: ./Wizard%20Spell%20List.md

### Cantrips

You know a number of Cantrips equal to the number shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard table.

### Preparing and Casting Spells

> *You can take time to prepare a new list of wizard spells by studying your spellbook to commit incantations and hand signs to memory.*

The Spell Slots per Spell Level table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Wizard Spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Full Rest.

You prepare the set of Wizard Spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Wizard Spells from your "Spellbook" (described below) equal to `your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level` (minimum of one). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table.

---

> #### Example
>
> *If you're a 3rd-level Wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence Score of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.*

---

**1/long rest:** After you finish a **Long Rest**, you can change the set of spells you have prepared. Preparing a spell requires 1 minute per spell level for each spell you prepare.

### Spellcasting Ability

> *Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization.*

You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when calculating the Saving Throw DC for a Wizard Spell you cast and when making an Attack Roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = `10 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier`
**Spell Attack Modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier`

---

## Spellbook
*1st-level Ability (Wizard)*

<!-- TODO: edit flavour text. -->

> *Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.*

As part of your "Starting Equipment", you gain a "Spellbook" containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. If you do not have a spellbook, you can turn any non-magical medium you can write on into your spellbook. Your spellbook is the repository of the Wizard Spells you know, except your Cantrips.

### Individual Research

> *The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse.*

Each time you gain a Wizard level, you add two Spells from the "Wizard Spell List" of your choice to your Spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have "Spell Slots", as shown on the Wizard table.

### Copy Spell
*1st-level Ability (Wizard)*  

<!-- TODO: edit flavourtext -->

> *You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.*
>
> *The time and cost to copy a spell represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, the fine inks you need to record it, and the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.*
>
> *If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.*

⏳ *varies* **(range: Touch, requires: your "Spellbook", and a spellbook, or a spell scroll)** — Add one Spell contained in target *spellbook* or *spell scroll* in range to your "Spellbook" if it is a Spell from the "Wizard Spell List" of a level you can prepare. For each level of the Spell, this ability takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. If you have the Spell prepared, or it is already in your "Spellbook", this process takes half as long and costs half as much.

---

## Master of Rituals
*1st-level Ability (Wizard)*  

You can cast Wizard Spells as a *Ritual* if that spell has the "Ritual" tag and the Spell is in your "Spellbook". <sup><sub>*(You do not need to have the spell prepared to do so.)*</sub></sup>

---

## Arcane Tradition
*2nd-Level Ability (Wizard)*

> *A wizard's school shapes and influences the magic they cast.*

Choose an arcane tradition. Your Arcane Tradition grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

| Arcane Tradition | Source                  |
|:-----------------|:------------------------|
| Abjuration       | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |
| Astromancy       | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |
| Chronomancy      | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |
| Conjuration      | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |
| Divination       | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |

| Illusion         | Unstable Isotopes (0.0) |

**Note:** Necromancy will come with the Evil Player Characters module, not the Player's Handbook

### Tradition Spells

Each Tradition has a list of Tradition Spells you add to your "Spellbook" at the Wizard levels noted in your Tradition's description. They don't count against the number of Spells you add to your "Spellbook" when you gain a Wizard level.

---

## Arcane Versatility
*3rd-level Ability (Wizard)*  

> *You are able to quickly review and prepare spells.*

◻️ **(1/short rest)** — Before a Short Rest, you may change up to `X` Spells you have prepared and prepare that many Spells from your "Spellbook", where `X = your Intelligence modifier`.

---

## Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level Ability (All Classes)*

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two ability scores by 1. You can't increase one of your ability scores above 20 using this Ability.

---

## Feat
*4th-level Ability (Wizard)*

You learn a feat. This feat can be either a General, Spellcasting, or Wizard feat. You learn additional feats at 8th, and 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th level.
