### Shattering Slam
*2nd-level Exploit*  
**Pre-requisites:** Strength 15 or greater
**Cost:** `3` "Stamina"  

> *You leap into the air, striking the ground as you land and forcing your aura into it, unleashing a destructive wave of energy.*

ðŸ”· â€” "Dash" up to 60 ft. to an unoccupied space on the ground, then at the end of this movement, make a *Melee Exploit Attack (Blast)* vs. *Fortitude* against creatures and objects in a 10 ft. sphere centred on you. If the ground in this area is loose earth or stone, it becomes *Difficult Terrain* until a creature uses an ðŸ”· to clear it. This *Attack* automatically succeeds against objects that are medium or smaller.

**Success:** It takes `4d8 [bludgeoning]` *Damage* and falls *Prone*.  
**Failure:** It takes half as much damage and does not fall *Prone*.  

You can only perform this "Exploit" once per turn.
