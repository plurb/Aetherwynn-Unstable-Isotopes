### Parry & Riposte
*1st-level Exploit*  
**Cost:** `1` "Stamina"  

> *You intercept an attack with your weapon or shield right before it hits you, then counter the attack.*

⚡ **(requires: [you are wielding a "Melee Weapon", or using a "Shield"])** — If a creature that you can see makes a *Melee Weapon Attack* against you, make an *Exploit Attack Roll*. If the result is greater than or equal to the *Attack Roll* of the triggering *Attack*, the triggering *Attack* fails.

If the triggering *Attack* fails, make a *Melee Weapon Attack* using a "Melee Weapon" you are wielding.
