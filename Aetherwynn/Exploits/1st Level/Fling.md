### Fling
*1st-level Exploit*
**Cost:** `1` "Stamina"  

> *"YEET!"*

ðŸ”· â€” Make a *Thrown Weapon Attack* vs. *Reflex* using an object you are holding, the "Short" and "Long" ranges of the *Attack* are multiplied by your *Exploit Ability Modifier* (or `1`). If the object does not have the "Thrown" property, it gains the "Thrown (60/120)" property, and has a "Damage Die" of `1d6 [bludgeoning]`. *(for objects larger than that can fit in your hand, the GM may determine a greater damage die/dice.)*

**Success:** The target falls *Prone* in addition to the *Attack's* other effects.
