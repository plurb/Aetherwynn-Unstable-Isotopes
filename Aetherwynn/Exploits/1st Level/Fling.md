ðŸ”· â€” Make a *Thrown Weapon Attack* vs. *Reflex* using an object you are holding, the "Short" and "Long" ranges of the *Attack* are multiplied by your *Exploit Ability Modifier* (or `1`). If the object does not have the "Thrown" property, it gains the "Thrown (60/120)" property, and has a "Damage Die" of `1d6 [bludgeoning]`.
