### Fling
*1st-level Exploit*
**Cost:** `1` "Stamina"  

🔺 — Make a *Thrown Weapon Attack* vs. *Reflex* using an object you are holding, the "Short" and "Long" ranges of the *Attack* are doubled. If the object does not have the "Thrown" property, it gains the "Thrown (30/60)" property, and has a "Damage Die" of `1d6 [bludgeoning]`.

**Success:** The target falls *Prone* in addition to the *Attack's* other effects.
