## Spellcasting
*1st-level Ability (Sorcerer)*

<!-- TODO: complete sorcerer spellcasting -->

### Spellcasting Ability

> *Your spellcasting is an extension of your being, and is driven by your emotions and will. Your spellcasting is directly proportional to your ability to express your will.*

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when calculating the Saving Throw DC for a Sorcerer Spell you cast and when making an Attack Roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = `8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

**Spell Attack Modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

---

## Metamagic

You gain two Metamagic options of your choice from *Sorcerer Metamagics*. You gain another one at 5th, 11th and 17th level in this class.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### Sorcery Points

You use Metamagic by expending a number of Sorcery Points. You can calculate the number of Sorcery Points you have as follows:

**Sorcery Points** = `your Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier` (minimum of 0)
