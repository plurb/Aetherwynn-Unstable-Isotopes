# The Psion

> *Magic is inherently tied to the brain, mind, and consiousness. However, for some, their magic is entirely tied to their brain. Etched into their subconscious in such a way that they couldn't imagine themselves without the ability to use magic. Whether due to random chance at birth, or due to hailing from a lineage of psions, a psion has innate magical talent. They never chose to be born this way, they just were.*
