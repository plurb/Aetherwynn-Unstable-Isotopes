# Fighter Fighting Styles

<!-- FIXME: re-work to new templating. -->

## Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons.

## Classical Swordplay
While wielding a finesse weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls and a +1 to your Armor Class so long as you are not using heavy armor or a shield.

## Defensive Fighting
So long as you are either wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

## Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with it.

## Great Weapon Fighting
When you make an attack roll with a heavy two-handed or versatile melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can treat a total roll of 4 or lower on the weapon's damage dice as a 5.

## Improvised Fighting
You are proficient in improvised weapons. Once per turn, when you use an object to make an improvised weapon attack, you can choose to roll the damage die twice and take the higher damage roll. When you do so, the object used to make the improvised attack is destroyed and can not be used for further attacks. You can't use this feature to destroy magical objects.

## Protector
When a creature you can see attacks you, or a target within 5 feet, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the target's Armor Class against that attack. You must be wielding a shield or a melee weapon to gain this benefit.

## Strongbow
You can use your Strength modifier, in place of Dexterity, for your attack and damage rolls with longbows and shortbows.

## Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. Moreover, when you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll of that attack.

## Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you have two free hands when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the beginning of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature you are grappling.

## Versatile Fighting
While wielding a single versatile weapon and no shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls with that weapon. While doing so, you can also use your bonus action to make a single grapple or shove attack, or to take the Use an Object action.

## Evasion
**Prerequisites: 7th level, Dexterity of 13 or greater.**

*You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell.*

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

## Great Weapon Master
**Prerequisites: 7th level, Strength of 15 or greater.**

*Your near herculean strength allows you to wield weapons sized for creatures larger than yourself.*

You can wield Large weapons without any drawbacks.

### Sniper
**Prerequisites: 14th level, Dexterity of 15 or greater.**

*You make even impossible shots with ease.*

Your normal and long range for Ranged Weapon Attacks increases by a number of feet equal to 10 times your Fighter level.
