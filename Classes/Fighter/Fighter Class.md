## Fighting Style
*1st-level Fighter Ability*

You learn one more fighting style of your choice at 7th level, as shown on the Fighter Table.

## Exploits
*1st-level Fighter Ability*

Also at 1st level, you begin to learn techniques that enhance your martial skill in and out of battle. You gain the following Abilities:

### Stamina
> *You have stamina greater than a mere common soldier, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a limited well of stamina represented by a number of Stamina Points. You can calculate the number of Stamina Points you have as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Fighter Level + your Constitution modifier`

To use an Exploit, you must expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain your expended Stamina Points when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

For Exploits that modify an Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw: you can only use one Exploit per Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw.

### Exploits Known
You learn two Exploits from the Fighter Exploit List. The Exploits Known column of the Fighter Table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn a Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level, as well as meet any other prerequisites (listed under **Prerequisites** in the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Fighter Level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the Fighter Exploit List.

### Saving Throws
If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit DC is calculated as follows:

**Exploit Save DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`

## Action Surge
*2nd-level Fighter Ability*
 
> *You can momentarily push yourself beyond human limits.*

**1/short rest:** On your turn, you can take one additional action. This action cannot be used to cast a spell.

Starting at 17th level, you can use Action Surge **2/short rest**, but only once per turn.

## Martial Archetype
*3rd-level Fighter Ability.*

> *You have distinguished yourself from the common warrior, and have gained skills that represent your unique skillset.*

Choose one of the following Martial Archetypes:

| Martial Archetype | Source                 |
| :---------------- | :--------------------- |
| Champion          | Unstable Isotope (0.0) |
| Marksman          | Unstable Isotope (0.0) |
| Battle Master     | Unstable Isotope (0.0) |

**Note:** Subclasses are listed seperately.

### Archetype Exploits
Each Archetype has a list of Archetype Exploits you learn at the fighter levels noted in your Archetype's description. They don't count against your total number of Exploits Known and can't be switched out for other Exploits. If you don't meet an Archetype Exploit's prerequisites, you learn it regardless.

## Ability Score Increase
*4th-level Fighter Ability*

When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this Ability.

## Feat

You learn a feat. This feat can be either a General, Martial, or Fighter feat. You learn additional feats at 8th, and 12th level.

## Multiattack
*5h-level Fighter Ability*

> *Beginning at 5th level, you can strike with inhuman speed.*

you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the number of attacks you can make as part of your Attack action increases; at 11th level (3 attacks) and at 17th level (4 attacks).

## Enhanced Strikes
*6th-level Ability (Fighter)*

Weapon Attacks you make count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

## Legendary Might
*Beginning at 9th level, you can overcome even the harshest adversity.*

**1/day:** If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.

At certain Fighter levels you can use this Ability additional times each day. You can use this Ability **2/day** starting at 13th level, and **3/day** starting at 17th level.
