## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Fighter)*  

You begin to learn techniques that enhance your martial skill in and out of battle. You gain the following Abilities:

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere common soldier, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a limited well of stamina represented by a number of Stamina Points. You can calculate the number of Stamina Points you have as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Fighter Level + your Constitution modifier`

To use an Exploit, you must expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain your expended Stamina Points when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

For Exploits that modify an Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw: you can only use one Exploit per Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw.

### Exploits Known

You learn two Exploits from the Fighter Exploit List. The Exploits Known column of the Fighter Table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn a Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level, as well as meet any other prerequisites (listed under **Prerequisites** in the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Fighter Level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the Fighter Exploit List.

### Saving Throws

If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit DC is calculated as follows:

**Exploit Save DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`
