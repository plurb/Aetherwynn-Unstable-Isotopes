## Rage
*1st-level Barbarian Ability*

> *You fight with an unchecked primal ferocity in battle.*

You can use a bonus action on your turn to enter a Rage. Until this ability ends, you gain the following effects, so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on any Constitution checks, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws that you make.
* Whenever you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack you deal a bonus 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. As you gain Barbarian levels, this damage bonus increases to match the Exploit Die column on the Barbarian table.
* You resist non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* You cannot cast spells or concentrate on spells or effects.
* Your Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, but it ends early if you become unconscious. You can extend your Rage to the end of your next turn by attacking a creature, taking damage, making a Strength check, or using a bonus action to extend it. You can maintain your Rage for up to 10 minutes.

Once you enter a Rage, you must finish a short or long rest before you can Rage again. As you gain Barbarian levels, you can Rage additional times between each short or long rest, as shown in the Rages column on the Barbarian table above.
