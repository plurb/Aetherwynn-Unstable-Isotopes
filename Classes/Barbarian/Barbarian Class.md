## Rage
*1st-level Ability (Barbarian)*

> *You fight with an unchecked primal ferocity in battle.*

**`X`/short rest:** You can use a bonus action on your turn to enter a Rage, where `X = the number shown in the Rages column of the Barbarian table`. Until this ability ends, you gain the following effects, so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on any Constitution checks, Strength checks, Constitution Saving Throws, and Strength Saving Throws that you make.
<!-- FIXME: re-word to be more explicit. -->
* When you make a weapon attack using Strength, you deal additional damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
* You gain resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* You cannot cast spells or concentrate on spells or effects.
* Your Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, but it ends early if you become unconscious. You can extend your Rage to the end of your next turn by attacking a creature, taking damage, making a Strength check, or using a bonus action to extend it. You can maintain your Rage for up to 10 minutes.

## Exploits
*1st-level Ability (Barbarian)*

> *You gain savage abilities that help you gore enemies and aid allies in and out of battle.*

You gain the following Abilities:

### Stamina

> *You have stamina greater than a mere outcast, which allows you to perform exploits greater than an ordinary warrior.*

You have a limited well of stamina represented by a number of Stamina Points. You can calculate the number of Stamina Points you have as follows:

**Stamina Points** = `your Barbarian level + your Constitution modifier`

To use an Exploit, you must expend a number of Stamina Points equal to the Exploit's level. You regain your expended Stamina Points when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

For Exploits that modify an Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw: you can only use one Exploit per Attack, Ability Check, or Saving Throw.

### Exploits Known
You learn two Exploits from the Barbarian Exploit List. The Exploits Known column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn an Exploit, you must be able to learn Exploits of its level, as well as meet any other prerequisites (listed under **Prerequisites** in the Exploit's entry).

Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one of the Exploits you learnt from this class with another Exploit from the Barbarian Exploit List.

### Saving Throws
If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit DC is calculated as follows:

**Exploit Save DC** = `8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier`

## Fighting Style
*2nd-level Ability (Barbarian)*

You learn one fighting style from *Barbian Fighting Styles*.

## Reckless Attack
*2nd-level Ability (Barbarian)*

> *You can throw aside concern for your defense to attack more accurately.*

When you take the Attack action, but before you make any attacks, you can choose to gain advantage on all attacks you make this turn. If you do, all attack rolls targeting you have advantage until the start of your next turn.
