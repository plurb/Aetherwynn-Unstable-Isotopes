# Class Abilities

## Expert Explorer
*1st-level Ability (Ranger)*

Choose one:

*Wilderness* — You and up to `X` creatures of your choice gain the following effects while [travelling](../../Rules/Exploration/Exploration.md) together:
* They are immune to being *Surprised*.
* Moving while *Hidden* does not halve their travel speed.
* Difficult Terrain does not reduce the group's travel speed.

*Urban* — Whenever you are in an urban area (such as a city or town), you are able to:
* Find accomodations (such as a tavern, a hotel, or safe house) suitable for your group.
* Find NPCs capable of aiding you and your group (such as a blacksmith, crime lord, or local noble). The behaviour, demands, and conditions of aid are up to the GM.
