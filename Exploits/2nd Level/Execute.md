### Execute
*2nd-level Exploit*
**Tempo:** 1 Attack
**Range:** Self
**Materials:** None
**Duration:** Instantaneous

In place of an attack, you can spend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to attempt to execute an incapacitated or prone creature within range of a melee weapon that you are holding. For each Exploit Die you spend you roll two Exploit Dice, adding your Strength modifier to the total. If the total exceeds the creature's remaining hit points, its current hit points are reduced to 0 and it is instantly slain. 

If this total doesn't exceed the creature's remaining hit points you deal damage equal to a roll of your Exploit Die.
