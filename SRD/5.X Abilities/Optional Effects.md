# Optional Effects

## 'You May' Clause

An optional effect is indicated by the following clause:

> ### Example N+1
> ... you may ...

Everything before 'you may' applies a condition for the ability/effect to take place, and everything after the 'you may' indicates the effect that the creature chooses to execute or not.

## 'You May, ... If you do' Clasue

An optional effect can also take the form of:

> ### Example N+2
> ... you may `A` ... . If you do, `B` ...

Everything before 'you may' applies a condition for the ability/effect to take place, and everything after the 'you may' indicates the effect that the creature chooses to execute or not. Then, if, and only if, the creature chose to execute `A`, the creature executes `B`. `A` is always executed before `B`.
