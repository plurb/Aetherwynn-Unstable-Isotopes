# 0.0 Rule Zero

These are the official rules of Aetherwynn. Local groups are welcome to modify them as they see fit. If youâ€™d like an exception to these rules, especially in an unfamiliar environment, please get the approval of the other players at your table before the game begins.

It is always important to remember the social contract before playing the game. "Don't be a dick."
