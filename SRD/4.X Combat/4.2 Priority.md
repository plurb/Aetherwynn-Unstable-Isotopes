# 4.3 Priority

Priority is the order abilities are added to the stack (see [SRD 1.6](https://github.com/plurb/Aetherwynn-Unstable-Isotopes/blob/main/SRD/1.X%20Game%20Concepts/1.6%20The%20Stack.md#16-the-stack)).

Whenever an ability is added to the stack, the turn creature has priority to add triggered abilities or a reaction to what was just added. Then, priority moves to the creature with the *lowest* initiative, and they declare their triggers/reactions, then the creature which goes before the last creature, then the one before them, and the one before them, and so on, until you reach the creature with the highest initiative.

This process is recursive. If anything is added to the stack, then priority starts from the bottom again.

Once nobody has any reactions/triggers, the stack is allowed to resolve.
