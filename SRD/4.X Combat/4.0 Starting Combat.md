# 4.0 Starting Combat

<!-- FIXME: tighten wording. -->

Add each creature to Initiative by rolling an Initiative check for each creature caught in combat. Hostile creatures are given the "Hostile" condition, and the creature(s) they are hostile towards noted.

> ## Hostile
> *Condition (SRD)*  
>
> A "Hostile" creature is hostile towards the creatures noted by this condition.

If a tie occurs, the creature with the greater Initiative Bonus goes first. If the bonuses are tied, then the creature with the greater Dexterity score goes first. If the Dexterity scores are also tied, then the creature that goes first should be decided at random.

Creatures with higher initiative take their turn before creatures with lower initiative.
