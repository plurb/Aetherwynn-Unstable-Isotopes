# 0.0 The Stack

The stack is a sequence of abilities that are either triggered by abilities, or that are activated as reactions.

Abilities are added to the top of the stack whenever they are used. Then, if no more abilities are added to the stack, the stack 'resovles', and the ability at the top of the stack resolves first, then the ability after that. and the ability after that, and so on.

> ## Example
> 
> 1. Player A casts Fireball.
> 2. Player B casts Absorb Elements.
> 3. Player C casts Counterspell, targetting B's Absorb Elements.

> ```
> < The Stack >
> Counterspell
> Absorb Elements
> Fireball

> How the stack resolves:
> 1. Counterspell resolves, and counters Absorb Elements.
> 2. Absorb Elements resolves, but since it was countered it does nothing.
> 3. Fireball resolves.
