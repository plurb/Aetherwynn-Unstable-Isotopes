# 0.2.1 Timing

There is a difference between optional and effects that occur "if" something happens, versus triggered effects that occur "when" something happens.

* If an ability says you can do something "when" something happens, the triggering event must be at the *top of the stack.* If the triggering ability is not at the top of the stack, then you cannot use the ability.
* If an ability says you can do something "if" something happens, then the triggering event can be *anywhere on the stack*, and you can use the ability at the first possible opportunity, so long as the conditions for using the ability still apply.

> ## Example:
> ```
> 1. Player A attacks Goblin A
> 2. stack resolves.
> ```
> 
> ```
> 1. Player A's attack hits!
> 2. Player A uses Disarming Strike
> 3. Player A attempts to use Tripping Strike
> ```
> 
> ```
> < The Stack >
> 1. [Tripping Strike, Player A]
> 2. [Disarming Strike, Player A]
> 3. [Attack hit, Player A]
> ```
> 
> Tripping strike says "when" you hit, not "if" you hit, therefore it cannot be used!
> 
> so, the only valid state for the stack is...
> 
> ```
> < The Stack >
> 1. [Disarming Strike, Player A]
> 2. [Attack hit, Player A]
> ```
