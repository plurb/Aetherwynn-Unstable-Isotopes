# 0.3 Citing The SRD

Sometimes you may wish to cite the SRD for a rule. In these cases, the citation should follow one of the following formats:
1. An in-text citation as follows: "SRD X.Y.Z", where X.Y.Z is the rule number. (e.g. "SRD 0.0" refers to rule zero, and this rule is SRD 0.3.)
2. An in-text citation as follows: "SRD X.Y.Z", where X.Y.Z is the rule number, and the text is styled as an embedded link to the specified rule (for now, the only official source to link is [GitHub: Aetherwynn Unstable Isotopes][GH]).
3. An in-text APA citation.  <!-- This is just a joke. Don't do this. -->
4. A direct link to the rule.

There will be many examples of citations within the SRD itself.
