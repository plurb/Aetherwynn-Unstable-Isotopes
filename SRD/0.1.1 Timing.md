# 0.1.1 Timing

There is a difference between optional and effects that occur "if" something happens, versus triggered effects that occur "when" something happens.

* If an ability says you can do something "when" something happens, the triggering event must be at the *top of the stack.* If the triggering ability is not at the top of the stack, then you cannot use the ability.
* If an ability says you can do something "if" something happens, then the triggering event can be *anywhere on the stack*, and you can use the ability at the first possible opportunity, so long as the conditions for using the ability still apply.
