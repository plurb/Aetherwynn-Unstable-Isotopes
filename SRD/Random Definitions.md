## A Point Is On The Ground

A point $p$ is on the ground if $p$ lies on a surface and $ \vec{g} \cdot \vec{n} < 0$ where $\vec{g}$ is the direction of gravity, and $\vec{n}$ is the surface normal at $p$.

## An Area Is On The Ground

A continuous region $R$ is on the ground if the entirety of $R$ lies on the surface of an object, and

$$
(\iint_{R} \,dR)^{-1} \cdot \iint_{R} \vec{g} \cdot \vec{n}_{x, y, z} \,dR < 0
$$

where $\vec{g}$ is the direction of gravity, and $\vec{n}$ is the surface normal at $(x, y, z)$ for $(x, y, z) \in R$.
